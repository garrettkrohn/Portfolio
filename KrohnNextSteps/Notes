4. Support a greeting variable that will change depending on time of day
5. Allow the user to specify which guest and which company should be used to populate the template messages
6. Allow the user to select one of the message templates that was loaded from the JSON file, or enter in a new message template
7. Generate the final message output that populates the fields
